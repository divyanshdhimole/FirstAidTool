# Project Statement
In emergency situations involving minor injuries, people often panic or lack immediate access to reliable first-aid information. While smartphones provide internet access, searching for first-aid procedures can be time-consuming and overwhelming, especially when multiple sources provide conflicting information. Additionally, many individuals lack basic knowledge of proper first-aid techniques for common injuries, which can lead to improper treatment or unnecessary hospital visits for minor issues that could be handled at home.
There is a need for a quick, offline-accessible, and straightforward tool that provides clear, step-by-step first-aid instructions for common minor injuries without the complexity of searching through medical websites or lengthy articles.
